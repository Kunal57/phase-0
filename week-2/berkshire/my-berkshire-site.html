1. What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Pairing 2.6, First HTML Page, was my favorite challenge at DBC thus far. The night before I had completed the lessons on Code Academy detailed in challenge 2.5, but the lessons were too easy. They taught me a concept and then I used the concept to complete the task. The strategy was beneficial but it didn't show me whether I had retained the information or not. Challenge 2.6 reassured me that I was in fact learning the tags and elements of html. Using the knowledge that I had learned to create a clone of something that already exists showed me that I was improving and capable of designing websites. It felt good to actually create something that a previous developer had already created. The pairing also provided me with an opportunity to discuss the knowledge I had learned with another student. In fact, my partner had previous knowledge of html and taught me a few more tricks to using the language. It was a great experience to actually apply the skills that I learned during the week.

2. How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I didn't know what was meant by "semantic HTML5 elements" so I researched it. My understanding of the concept is that there are sementic and non-semantic HTML elements. Sementic elements are those that clearly define the content such as <form>, <table>, or <img>. Non-emantic elements are those that tell us nothing about the content such as <div> and <span>. Using semantic HTML elements was rather easy due to the fact that they tell us about the content that should be within the tags. Tags such as <header>, <body>, and <footer> tell us exactly where the content within those tags will be displayed on a web page. For a new developer such as myself, this allows me to organize my content within the code more easily without looking at the display in a web browser.

3. How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Maintaining best practices was difficult in this challenge. When you view the Berkshire Hathaway website on-line, it is one of the most simplistic sites on the web. Nonetheless, even a simple site like this has basic CSS elements to help format the site. Things such as heading tags, columns, and text alignment. It was hard to stick to the "skeleton", bare html elements within the code. My partner and I even separated the links into two columns before reverting with the knowledge that we'd focus on CSS in next weeks challenge. When looking at the Berkshire site, we had to focus purely on the information on the site. The words, images, and links. Those would be the elements we would code using html, and we ignored the rest of the CSS styling. I believe we did a good job with indentation. Indentation helped keep out code organized and easy to read. I believe we put in effort throughout the whole pairing to make sure that our code was property indented to help ourselves and our pair read the code. Hopefully, it's also helping you, the reviewer, view the code.

4. What seems good and bad about HTML?

There are many pros and cons to HTML. I'm sure if I researched, I could find pages upon pages of positives and negatives. As for my own evaluation of HTML, I only see positives with the information that I'm exposed to. HTML is great for transforming the content in a wireframe to actually appearing on a web page. It allows me to see what raw content will be displayed on the site since CSS simply adds formating. HTML is also good because as its name suggests, it uses hyper text, meaning that it allows the content on the page to link to another page. This adds some kind of functionality within the web pages as it allows users to navigate to others content that they may find useful. Another pro is the use of sementic HTML elements as we discussed above. The use of sementic elements allows a developer to see exactly were the content will be displayed based on the tag. Some cons that come with HTML is that it uses non-sementic tags which can confuse a developer at times. It also has complex elements such as tables and divs which can be nested inside each other to create a complex structure of code. Overall, since I'm not familiar with an alternative language for HTML, I think it serves its purpose very well by creating a skeleton interface of information for developers to expand upon using other languages.

5. What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I don't have tricks. My only "trick" is to practice often and the syntax will stick with me. The sementic elements make it easy for me to remember their names and the content they should include. As for the other elements, such as <a href>, <img>, <h1>, and <p>, I remember these because I use them so frequently. I'd love to learn of any tricks or tips that others may have regarding HTML. If you have any tricks that you use, feel free to leave a comment or mention it in your review. Thanks!
