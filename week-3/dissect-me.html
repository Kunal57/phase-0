        <!-- What are the benefits of version control? -->
        <p>
          Version control allows a developer to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files and merge revisions made by different people. It is a essential tool in the developers toolbox because version control has many benefits to help developers grow their code. One benefit of version control is that files can be sent to other developers for them to modify. After they have made changes to the file, the file can be merged back into the original project. Another benefit of version control is that it tracks all of the changes made within the project. A developer can view information regarding changes and merges to the project. One last benefit of version control is the developer can rollback a file if need be. This is often useful when a developer detects a bug in the code to which he can simply rollback to a previous saved point. These are three of the biggest benefits that version control provides to a developer.

        <!-- How does git help you keep track of changes? -->
        <p>
          Git is a program that equips file folders with version control. A file/folder can be converted into a repository (a version control file or folder) with the git init command. This will create a secret directory within the folder that enables git to track changes. 
          Git tracks changes by creating saving points. These saving points are called commits and come with a unique ID, a message, an author, and a timestamp. Each commit is saved onto the git log and can be viewed in the future. This process of committing changes helps developers track changes because they can see the git log to find crucial information regarding the progress of the project. They can see who made changes, when changes were made, and what features were added within the change. Git commit allows developers to take a snapshot of the code at the time of the commit and afterwards review all the snapshots to see the progress of the project.

        <!-- Why use GitHub to store your code? -->
        <p>
          GitHub is a cloud-based repository management service. GitHub is an addition to git to help keep code safe. Although you may be using git within your project to track changes and have the safety of the rollback feature of version control, your project is still not safe. Life is unpredictable and your project can disappear if your computer is stolen, damaged, or malfunctions. GitHub allows your repositories to live in the cloud. It allows the cloud to have a copy of your repository so that you and other developers can remotely access that copy at anytime.
          Not only does GitHub keep your code safe and stored on the cloud but it also has some very helpful features for developers. GitHub provides a easy method of collaborating on projects with team members. Instead of exchanging modified code amongst team members (which can get messy really quick), GitHub allows developers to push and pull code to and from the remote repository in the cloud in real time. Another helpful feature of GitHub is the ability to fork and clone repositories. If you want to collaborate on a project with another developer, cloning a repository onto your local computer and pushing the changes would be ideal. If you want to move in a different direction with the code, you can fork the code, which simply means that you can create a copy of the repository onto your GitHub profile. These are just two of the big features that developers can benefit by storing their code on GitHub.
