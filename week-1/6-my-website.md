## Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

### Create a Repository
1. Navigate to your GitHub Profile.
2. In the navigation menu on the top right side, you should see a “+” next to your avatar.
3. Press the “+” and select “New Repository.”
4. On the repository page, enter a repository name.
5. Select whether you want to repository to be public (allowing others to see your work) or private (which is for premium GitHub members).
6. Add a license & Readme if you need.
7. Create the repository by clicking the “Create Repository” button on the bottom of the page.

Following these steps will create a remote repository on GitHub. Afterwards, the developer must clone the repository down to their local computer to begin making changes.

### Cloning a Repository
1. Navigate to the repository that you want to clone down to your local computer.
2. Copy the HTTPS URL provided on the repository page.
3. Open up your command line (terminal).
4. Navigate to the directory that you want to store the repository on (Use cd DIRECTORY to change to the directory & ls to list the contents of the directory).
5. Enter the command git clone and paste the repository URL.
6. If prompted for a username & password, enter the necessary information and the repository should be successfully cloned onto your local computer.

This is the step by step process of how a repository is created and cloned down with GitHub.

## Describe what open source means.

To understand what open source means, you must first understand what source code is. Source code is the instructions you type into a computer, readable by humans, that allows us to run programs. It is the methods that you develop to produce an output. Most companies create programs, convert them to computer language for the CPU to understand, and then release them to the public. The public doesn't have any way of looking into the source code to make any alterations to see the source code. This is perfectly acceptable because the program is the property of the company since they created it and they have the right to distribute it as they wish.
The opposite of this would be open source code, which is when the source code is available to the public to view and customize as they wish. Open source code not only lets you access the output of the program, but it also lets you look into the code of the program. This is what is meant by open source, the ability to look into the code of a program and not simply be able to use the program to get output.
An example would be of Adobe Photoshop. The program is sold by Adobe and we can use it to alter photos. If Adobe by some change in heart decided to make it open source, it would make the code behind Photoshop available to the public. As a result, the public could customize their own Adobe Photoshop features and also look into how the software is actually made, maybe even inspiring multiple copycat programs.

## What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I like the idea of open source after learning about it. I feel like open source projects have the opportunity to develop and advance faster than others. This is because if the project was open source, it would give the ability of viewing and modifying the code to much more people out there in the world. The more people viewing and modifying your code means the ability to have many brains and perspectives looking into the project. Although this can be counterproductive at times, through a service like GitHub, I believe the developer could choose which direction he wants his project to do and merge the needed collaborations from there.
The idea of open source doesn't make me nervous or protective because I know there are other options out there. Open source is not the only way to create a program. If a developer feels that he can create a successful program, and he has a vision and a great team, he doesn't have to make it open source. Also, if his intention is to make money off the program, an open source project wouldn't be acceptable because the source code would be available and many people could contribute to the end result. 
Open source doesn't feel like a utopia because it isn't the perfect solution for every project. I think the circumstances, the goal, and the team really factor into if you want something to be open sourced or not. It's a great opportunity for everyone to have the code, but it may not be the best option for you.

## Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licensing is a improved alternative to simply releasing your code for the world to use. It simply grants specific permissions to developer to use your work. Simply releasing the code without a license means that you forgo the ability to copyright the code and no one that uses your code has to acknowledge that you are the originator. Licensing however helps you keep the rights are the author of the code while providing others with the easy of using the code freely. It allows others to use your code without asking for permission but it also prevents them from claiming that the code is in fact their own code. 

## What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

This challenge was great for reviewing a lot of the information that I had learnt in the earlier challenges. Right from the start, I had to create a GitHub repository and followed the instructions in the challenge. I felt as though I would create a repository by myself with only the knowledge of what to name the repository. I also cloned the repository down into my DBC folder. I made sure to clone it to my DBC folder instead of my phase-0 folder as that would mean a repository would be located in a repository which can't happen. After that I created a new file, index.html, and committed and pushed my changes. All of this felt like review, and I was grad I could get through it without needing to look back for any help. I didn't have any "aha" moments in specific but I felt like I had a lot of tiny "aha" moments each time I followed the workflow correctly. I began to understand slowly why we needed to do certain tasks like merging the master into the branch we created, and why we need to make sure the master was updated. Overall, it was one of the easier challenges for me and I didn't struggle with it at all. This is probably because I had previous experience with GitHub and committing & pushing changes.

## Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I didn't use any additional resources but I occasionally Google words to see what they mean. No specific websites though.
