# 1.4 Create, Fork, and Clone Respoitories

## If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

### Creating
Navigate to your GitHub Profile.
In the navigation menu on the top right side, you should see a “+” next to your avatar.
Press the “+” and select “New Repository.”
On the repository page, enter a repository name.
Select whether you want to repository to be public (allowing others to see your work) or private (which is for premium GitHub members).
Add a license if you need.
Create the repository by clicking the “Create Repository” button on the bottom of the page.

### Forking
Forking is done all on GitHub. It allows you to take the existing repository on GitHub and make a copy that belong to you.

Navigate to the page of the repository you would like to clone.
Hit the “Fork” button on the repository page.
Select the profile that you want to copy the repository to.
The repository should now be added to your repositories.

### Cloning
After forking a repository to your profile, the repository must be moved down onto your local computer.

Navigate to the repository that you want to clone down to your local computer.
Copy the HTTPS URL provided on the repository page.
Open up your command line.
Navigate to the directory that you want to store the repository on.
Enter the command git clone and paste the repository URL.
If prompted for a username & password, enter the necessary information and the repository should be successfully clones onto your local computer.
Why would you fork a repository as opposed to creating a new one? Well, forking a repository on GitHub create a COPY of that repository onto your account. Creating a new repository means that the repository would be empty. Forking a repository allows you to COPY all of the files from the repository essentially creating an identical copy for you to clone down and work on. Creating a new repository just seems like it would be so much more work because you want have to create all of the files on the repository and push them up to your new repository. Overall, forking allows you to save time by just copy over work that has already been created.

## What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I didn't struggle with the set up of git and GitHub at all. I've worked on a few projects before that allowed me to become familiar with the git and GitHub commands. When introducing this information, I could recall how I used most of the git commands to commit changes. I also was familiar with creating repositories, forking repositories, and cloning repositories on GitHub so the information was mostly reassurance that I was doing the process right.

Throughout the process I learned that through practice, git and GitHub will become easier to use. The two pieces of software are crucial in the development environment and through repetition, the process and commands will become become second nature to me. I realize that this is only the basics, and that I have a lot more to learn.
