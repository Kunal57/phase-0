# 1.2 The Command Line

## What is a shell? What is "bash?"
After watching the "Introduction to the Shell" video and running through the Command Line Crash Course, I still didn't fully understand what a shell and what bash were. So I did some research and I'll try to explain my comprehension of the two below. 

In the modern era, the average human operates their computer through a graphical user interface. These are the folders and files we see when we open up finder on a mac. This wasn't always the case though, and it surely isn't the only way to operate a computer. Another way to operate a computer besides viewing and executing commands with a graphical user interface is through the command line interfaces such as shell. Shell is basically a program that communicates the user input on the keys to the operating system in the machine. The shell is another, less graphical, way of operating a computer. Bash is just one type of shell program that Linux has that communicates input to the operating system. There are plenty more in the world but bash is one of the more popular options of shell and the command line interface.

## What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
The most challenging part of the material was retaining all the information thrown my way. The Command Line is a new concept for me and simply intaking, understanding, and explain the material to myself was challenging because of the seer size of the knowledge. After one topic in the video, or one section of the crash course, I would have to it back and fit the information into my memory back. I understand I'm still beginning to learn code and the command line but I wanted to know how the information would fit into the bigger picture when coding. 

Aside from the knowledge aspect, staying focused was also a struggle. I eliminated all my distractions but when going through 20 commands consecutively, it becomes dry. Either that or I need some more sleep. I need to work on staying focused so I can actually be challenged by the task instead of taking a break to slowly take it in. 

## Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
Yes. The crash course was very helpful in that it showed you exactly what to type in and the results that should be outputted to you. If I didn't get the correct output, I rechecked my input or consoled google for my mistake. 

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
In my opinion, I believe pwd, ls, and cd are the most important commands. This is because as stated in the crash course, "If you get lost, the us ls and pwd to figure out where you are, then go to where you need to be with cd." These seem to be the most basic commands of Linux, comparable to moving the mouse on a graphical user interface. Due to the essence of these fundamental commands, I would say they are the most important to me. Once you know them, you can navigate through a computer in the command line interface.

## Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

### pwd
-pwd is the command to print working directory. The command returns the path to the directory which the user is currently on.

### ls
-ls is the command to list directory. The command returns all the files and other directories that fall under current directory.

### mv
-mv is to move or rename a file. To remain the file, you type the command followed by the title of the file and then the new name. To move the file, you type the command followed by the file and then the location you want to move the file to.

### cd
-cd is to change the directory. Simply typing the command will return the directory to the root folder. Typing the command followed by a directory or a path will move the user into the directory.

### ../
-../ is a command to move one up in the directory. If a user doesn't want to simply go back to the root, he can type cd .. to move one up in the path. This command can be combined multiple times to move up multiple times within the path.

### touch
-touch is to create a new empty file. It will create a simply .txt file in whatever directory the command is executed.

### mkdir
-mkdir is to make a directory. Making a directory is like making a new folder in the graphical user interface model. Folders and directories are the same.

### less
-less allows the content to be displayed in a page format so the content doesn't consume the whole page. You can scroll down and up as need be to view all of the content. This command seems to be the opposite of cat which displays all of the content at once without paging or stopping.

### rmdir
-rmdir is to remove a directory. This is like deleting a folder. If the directory has content inside, it cannot be deleted unless another command is used like rm -rf.

### rm
-rm is for remove. Remove allows a user to remove files within a directory so he can make more room or eventually remove the directory itself.


### help/man
-help is the same as man on Linux I believe. man stands for manual and allows the user to open up the manual for any Linux command. The manual has a more detailed desciption of the command as well as add ons to that specific command.
