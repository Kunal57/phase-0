# 1.1 Thing About Time Reflection

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
After watching all of the videos provided in the Think About Time assignment, I learned some new techniques and also revisited some old techniques that I was already familiar with. In regards to new techniques, I learned about Creating a Habit from Charles Duhigg. In the short video, I learned that contrary to the popular saying, "Fake it till you make it" it is often more beneficial to first accomplish the behavior/habit and the cognitive change will follow. He gives the example of an individual that behaves like a nice person will eventually become a nice person.

I also learned about the idea of tiny habits creating a big change from BJ Fogg. BJ presents in his TED Talk about the idea of pairing a small behavior with an already existing habit to eventually make that behavior a habit. An accumulation of small habits will eventually lead to big changes within ones life. He provides the audience with an example of flossing teeth. After pairing the behavior of flossing one tooth after you brush and rewarding yourself, the behavior of flossing after brushing will become automatic without the need for any reward.

As for preexisting techniques that I was already familiar with, I learned more about the Pomodoro Technique and the Growth Mindset. I experimented with the Pomodoro technique a few years back but it didn't grow on me. Sometimes I would be heavily into the work I was doing and after the set time, I would take a break and lose my flow. Other times I wasn't in the flow and forcing myself to do work within the time frame produced bad results. As for the growth mindset technique, I love it. I just finished reading Mindset by Carol Dweck and I'm working everyday to establish a growth mindset in all the facets of my life. 

What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
 The Pomodoro technique is a style of time boxing. Time boxing is when a person or team sets a time limit of working towards a goal. After the designated time is up, the team or person reflects on the work completed to reach the goal so they can self-assess progress and make changes to plans to help achieve the goal. In application to Phase 0, I can use time boxing to help me set aside time to work and time to self-reflect on the goal. My adjustment to using the technique would be to use each lesson as a time box. Instead of a designated time, I would complete a lesson and then reflect on what I have just completed and how it related to the goal I have set.

How do you manage your time currently?
Even before DBC I researched a lot of different ways to help me manage time and be more productive. The most effective way that works for me right now is to set up a schedule of the days activities the night before. 

The night before, I sit down before going to bed and run through the next day. The structure of the habits I have on a day-to-day basis are already preset on my schedule. Reading and coding times are habits so I already reserve the time to do them each time. Besides those two habits, I try to wake up and go to sleep everyday at the same time so my biological clock maintains a healthy schedule. Other than the habits I have, I look at my calendar and set time out for any events or appointments that I have to attend. Presetting my schedule the night before helps me prepare for the next day immediately after I wake up. I know time I must wake up, I know what time I need to be at places, and I know what I must be doing. It helps me manage time effectively and helps me maintain the habits that I have to help me change. 

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
As discussed above, my current strategy is working and I expect to maintain the strategy while working on Phase 0 as well as the rest of Dev Bootcamp. 

Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
I learned a lot of new techniques and strategies in the lesson. The strategy that I most want to work on, that I had knowledge of before DBC is the growth mindset. Everyday I try to cancel out any negativity I have in my life and focus on having a growth mindset. When faced with challenges, I work to overcome them with time and effort. My mentality is shifting from just doing things to actually doing them with the intention of learning something. If I watch a video or read an article and I can't recall what was discussed, I immediately reread it. I'm not there yet, but I hope to work on my growth mindset throughout my time at DBC and for the remainder of my life. 

What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
Since I don't have to work, my overall plan is simply to go to the library for 8 hours a day and work on DBC material like its my job. I develop a schedule the day before with any additional events that I have to attend, but decided that I am focused on going to the library (better environment) and working. The problem that I run into is being distracted easily. I self diagnosed myself with some sort of attention disorder and I can't maintain focus on a task for more than 15 minutes. I'm trying to become a better person each day and improve my focus and willpower but it's still a work in progress. Hopefully the enjoyment of coding will drown out any distractions that I may face.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
After watching the "Introduction to the Shell" video and running through the Command Line Crash Course, I still didn't fully understand what a shell and what bash were. So I did some research and I'll try to explain my comprehension of the two below. 

In the modern era, the average human operates their computer through a graphical user interface. These are the folders and files we see when we open up finder on a mac. This wasn't always the case though, and it surely isn't the only way to operate a computer. Another way to operate a computer besides viewing and executing commands with a graphical user interface is through the command line interfaces such as shell. Shell is basically a program that communicates the user input on the keys to the operating system in the machine. The shell is another, less graphical, way of operating a computer. Bash is just one type of shell program that Linux has that communicates input to the operating system. There are plenty more in the world but bash is one of the more popular options of shell and the command line interface.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
The most challenging part of the material was retaining all the information thrown my way. The Command Line is a new concept for me and simply intaking, understanding, and explain the material to myself was challenging because of the seer size of the knowledge. After one topic in the video, or one section of the crash course, I would have to it back and fit the information into my memory back. I understand I'm still beginning to learn code and the command line but I wanted to know how the information would fit into the bigger picture when coding. 

Aside from the knowledge aspect, staying focused was also a struggle. I eliminated all my distractions but when going through 20 commands consecutively, it becomes dry. Either that or I need some more sleep. I need to work on staying focused so I can actually be challenged by the task instead of taking a break to slowly take it in. 

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
Yes. The crash course was very helpful in that it showed you exactly what to type in and the results that should be outputted to you. If I didn't get the correct output, I rechecked my input or consoled google for my mistake. 

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
In my opinion, I believe pwd, ls, and cd are the most important commands. This is because as stated in the crash course, "If you get lost, the us ls and pwd to figure out where you are, then go to where you need to be with cd." These seem to be the most basic commands of Linux, comparable to moving the mouse on a graphical user interface. Due to the essence of these fundamental commands, I would say they are the most important to me. Once you know them, you can navigate through a computer in the command line interface.

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd is the command to print working directory. The command returns the path to the directory which the user is currently on.

-ls is the command to list directory. The command returns all the files and other directories that fall under current directory.

-mv is to move or rename a file. To remain the file, you type the command followed by the title of the file and then the new name. To move the file, you type the command followed by the file and then the location you want to move the file to.

-cd is to change the directory. Simply typing the command will return the directory to the root folder. Typing the command followed by a directory or a path will move the user into the directory.

-../ is a command to move one up in the directory. If a user doesn't want to simply go back to the root, he can type cd .. to move one up in the path. This command can be combined multiple times to move up multiple times within the path.

-touch is to create a new empty file. It will create a simply .txt file in whatever directory the command is executed.

-mkdir is to make a directory. Making a directory is like making a new folder in the graphical user interface model. Folders and directories are the same.

-less allows the content to be displayed in a page format so the content doesn't consume the whole page. You can scroll down and up as need be to view all of the content. This command seems to be the opposite of cat which displays all of the content at once without paging or stopping.

-rmdir is to remove a directory. This is like deleting a folder. If the directory has content inside, it cannot be deleted unless another command is used like rm -rf.

-rm is for remove. Remove allows a user to remove files within a directory so he can make more room or eventually remove the directory itself.

-help is the same as man on Linux I believe. man stands for manual and allows the user to open up the manual for any Linux command. The manual has a more detailed desciption of the command as well as add ons to that specific command.

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
Creating

Navigate to your GitHub Profile.
In the navigation menu on the top right side, you should see a “+” next to your avatar.
Press the “+” and select “New Repository.”
On the repository page, enter a repository name.
Select whether you want to repository to be public (allowing others to see your work) or private (which is for premium GitHub members).
Add a license if you need.
Create the repository by clicking the “Create Repository” button on the bottom of the page.
Forking

Forking is done all on GitHub. It allows you to take the existing repository on GitHub and make a copy that belong to you.

Navigate to the page of the repository you would like to clone.
Hit the “Fork” button on the repository page.
Select the profile that you want to copy the repository to.
The repository should now be added to your repositories.
Cloning

After forking a repository to your profile, the repository must be moved down onto your local computer.

Navigate to the repository that you want to clone down to your local computer.
Copy the HTTPS URL provided on the repository page.
Open up your command line.
Navigate to the directory that you want to store the repository on.
Enter the command git clone and paste the repository URL.
If prompted for a username & password, enter the necessary information and the repository should be successfully clones onto your local computer.
Why would you fork a repository as opposed to creating a new one? Well, forking a repository on GitHub create a COPY of that repository onto your account. Creating a new repository means that the repository would be empty. Forking a repository allows you to COPY all of the files from the repository essentially creating an identical copy for you to clone down and work on. Creating a new repository just seems like it would be so much more work because you want have to create all of the files on the repository and push them up to your new repository. Overall, forking allows you to save time by just copy over work that has already been created.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I didn't struggle with the set up of git and GitHub at all. I've worked on a few projects before that allowed me to become familiar with the git and GitHub commands. When introducing this information, I could recall how I used most of the git commands to commit changes. I also was familiar with creating repositories, forking repositories, and cloning repositories on GitHub so the information was mostly reassurance that I was doing the process right.

Throughout the process I learned that through practice, git and GitHub will become easier to use. The two pieces of software are crucial in the development environment and through repetition, the process and commands will become become second nature to me. I realize that this is only the basics, and that I have a lot more to learn.
